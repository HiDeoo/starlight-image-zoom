title: Zoom Component
---

To create zoomable images in contexts where the Starlight Image Zoom plugin cannot automatically apply such functionality, you can use the `<Zoom>` component.

## Import

```tsx
import { Zoom } from 'starlight-image-zoom/components'
```

## Usage

Use the `<Zoom>` component to wrap an image or an [SVG component](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#svg-components) and make it zoomable.

By default, images defined in your content will be zoomable, except for a few [expected cases](/ignoring-images/#exceptions), such as icons, images embedded in interactive elements, or images embedded in elements with the `not-content` CSS class.
Some advanced use cases, such as rendering images in a loop of an Astro component, or using SVG components, cannot be automatically detected by the plugin.

For such cases, you can use the `<Zoom>` component to wrap the image or SVG component, which will make it zoomable.

## `<Zoom>` Props

The `<Zoom>` component accepts the following props:

### `label`

**required**  
**type:** `string`

A label to provide context to zoomable images, e.g. zoom and unzoom buttons, for assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

This label does not have to be the same as the image's `alt` attribute or the SVG's `<title>` element.
In the case of SVGs, the `label` prop can be relatively short, e.g. "Sun icon", while the `<title>` element of the SVG can be more descriptive, e.g. "A yellow sun icon with rays extending outward".
