description: Learn how to ignore images from being zoomable when using the Starlight Image Zoom plugin.
---

By default, all images in your documentation content are zoomable when using the Starlight Image Zoom plugin with a few exceptions.

## Exceptions

The following images are ignored by the Starlight Image Zoom plugin:

- Icons rendered using the Starlight [`<Icon>`](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#icon) component
- Images embedded in interactive elements such as buttons, links, etc.
- Images embedded in elements with the [`not-content`](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#compatibility-with-starlights-styles) CSS class

## Ignoring specific images

The Starlight Image Zoom plugin will ignore images with the `data-zoom-off` attribute. You can add this attribute to any image to prevent it from being zoomable.

```mdx "data-zoom-off"
---
// src/content/docs/example.mdx
title: My page title
---

import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import algorithm from '../../assets/demo/algorithm.jpg'

<Image src={algorithm} alt="A book with a diagram on it" data-zoom-off />
```

The code above generates the following image on the page, which is not zoomable:

import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import algorithm from '../../assets/demo/algorithm.jpg'

<Image src={algorithm} alt="A book with a diagram on it" data-zoom-off />

import ImageAttribution from '../../components/ImageAttribution.astro'

<ImageAttribution id="a-book-with-a-diagram-on-it-nuz3rK5iiKg" name="Андрей Сизов" username="alpridephoto" />
