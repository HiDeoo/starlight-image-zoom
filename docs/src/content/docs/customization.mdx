Zoomed images are displayed in a modal [`<dialog>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) which includes a backdrop displayed behind the image.

## Customizing the backdrop

By default, the backdrop background color is an non-transparent color based on Starlight's color palette.
You can customize this color using the `--starlight-image-zoom-backdrop-bg` CSS custom property.

To learn how to add custom CSS styles to Starlight, refer to the [“Custom CSS styles”](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#custom-css-styles) guide in the Starlight documentation.

```css
:root {
  /* Custom backdrop background color in dark mode. */
  --starlight-image-zoom-backdrop-bg: oklch(0 0 0);
}

:root[data-theme='light'] {
  /* Custom backdrop background color in light mode. */
  --starlight-image-zoom-backdrop-bg: oklch(100% 0 0);
}
```

## Customizing zoomed images using IDs

When zooming images, the `id` attribute of the image is not copied to the zoomed image in the modal.
If you are using the `id` attribute to identify images and customize their appearance using CSS, you can use the `data-zoom-id` attribute which will contain the `id` of the original image.

For example, if your page includes Mermaid diagrams with IDs like `mermaid-1`, `mermaid-2`, etc., the following CSS snippet inverts the color samples of all the diagrams in dark mode:

```css
:root[data-theme='dark'] img[id^='mermaid-'] {
  filter: invert(1);
}
```

To apply the same effect to the zoomed images, you can use the `data-zoom-id` attribute in your CSS selector:

```css
:root[data-theme='dark'] img[id^='mermaid-'],
:root[data-theme='dark'] img[data-zoom-id^='mermaid-'] {
  filter: invert(1);
}
```
