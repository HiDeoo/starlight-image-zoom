'starlight-image-zoom': minor

Adds a new `<Zoom>` component to wrap images or SVG components and make them zoomable.

This can be useful for advanced use cases where the plugin cannot automatically apply zoom functionality, such as rendering images in a loop of an Astro component or using SVG components. Learn more in the [“Zoom component”](https://starlight-image-zoom.vercel.app/components/zoom/) guide.
