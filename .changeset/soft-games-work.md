'starlight-image-zoom': minor

Adds a new `data-zoom-id` attribute to zoomed images matching the `id` of the original image if it exists.

This can be useful if you are relying on the `id` attribute to customize the appearance of images using CSS and also want to apply the same styles to zoomed images.
